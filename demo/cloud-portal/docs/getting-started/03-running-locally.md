# Running Locally

This guide covers starting the development server and verifying everything works.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not done)
bun install

# 2. Start development server
bun run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

---

## Verify the Application

### 1. Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/_healthz
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### 2. Open in Browser

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. You should see the login page
3. Log in with your OIDC credentials
4. Navigate to any organization/project

### 3. Check Terminal Logs

You should see structured logs in your terminal:

```
🌐 Starting React Router development server...
📊 Observability initialization results: { sentry: true, otel: false }
[INFO] GET / 200 45ms
  → requestId: abc-123-def
```

If `LOG_CURL=true`, you'll also see CURL commands for API calls.

## Optional: Local Observability Stack

For full observability (metrics, tracing, dashboards), start the Docker stack:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:

| Service        | URL                    | Description                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Grafana        | http://localhost:3002  | Metrics dashboards (admin/admin) |
| Prometheus     | http://localhost:9090  | Metrics collection               |
| Jaeger         | http://localhost:16686 | Distributed tracing              |
| OTEL Collector | localhost:4317/4318    | Telemetry ingestion              |

To view app metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
```

To stop the stack:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Environment variable errors

```
Error: Required environment variable SESSION_SECRET is not set
```

**Solution:** Ensure your `.env` file exists and has all required variables. See [Environment Setup](./02-environment-setup.md).

### OIDC login failing

- Verify `AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER` is a valid HTTPS URL
- Verify `AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` is correct
- Check that your OIDC provider has `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` as an allowed redirect URI

### API calls failing

- Check `API_URL` in your `.env`
- Verify you can reach the API: `curl $API_URL/_healthz`
- Check if you're logged in (session may have expired)

---

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] App loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Health check returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] Can log in successfully
- [ ] See structured logs in terminal
- [ ] Can navigate to organizations/projects
